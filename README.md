# BasinOfAttraction
Filippov systems are often used for modeling mechanical, electrical and biological systems. The computation of their basins of attraction is a very relevant problem in applications; for example, it provides useful information about complex behavior caused by friction impacts or damping, in the design of mechanical devices.

The ESCM is a numerical tool for studying the basins of attraction in Filippov systems with a single discontinuity manifold. The algorithm is an extension of the Simple Cell Mapping method and it was implemented in the Matlab Environment.
